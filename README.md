## NO-SQL database programmed in C!

Im approaching this project with a renewed learning vigour. I copied
some code from the book Redis from scratch but feel like that was
mostly useless as a learning excersise as it lacked the tacticle feel
of designing and writing code for myself.

My new approach will be understanding concepts and coming up with code
solutions myself: get ready for some shocking spaghetti
